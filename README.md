## Fantasy EPL Fantasy football analysis

In this project I analysed data obtained from the [Fantrax English Premier League fantasy football website](https://www.fantrax.com/fantasy/games/season-long/epl).

The goal of this project was to learn and apply common analytics and visualization tools such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

I chose to use Jupyter Notebook in order to be able to present the data in a cleaner and legible way.
